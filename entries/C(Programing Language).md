# Introduction to C Programming

**C** is a general-purpose programming language created by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Laboratories** in **1972**. Despite its age, C remains widely used due to its powerful features and influence on other languages. Let's explore the fundamentals of C:

1. **Features of C**:
   - **General Purpose**: C can be used for various applications, from system programming to web development.
   - **Portable**: C code can run on different platforms with minimal modifications.
   - **Low-Level Memory Access**: C provides direct memory manipulation through pointers.
   - **Fast Execution**: C programs execute efficiently.
   - **Clean Syntax**: C's syntax is concise and expressive.

2. **Getting Started**:
   - Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
   - Write your first C program:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>
     
     int main() {
         printf("Hello, C!\n");
         return 0;
     }
     ```
     - Compile: `gcc myprogram.c -o myprogram`
     - Execute: `./myprogram`

3. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Variables**: Store data (e.g., `int x = 10;`).
   - **Functions**: Define reusable code blocks.
   - **Control Structures**: Use loops and conditionals.
   - **Pointers**: Manipulate memory addresses.
   - **Standard Library**: C provides essential functions (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).

4. **Why Learn C?**
   - Foundation for many languages (e.g., C++, Java).
   - Understand low-level details (memory, pointers).
   - Widely used in system programming and embedded systems.
