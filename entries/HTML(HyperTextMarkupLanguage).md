# Introduction to HTML



HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It provides a structured way to define the content and layout of a webpage. Here are some key points about HTML:



1. **Tags and Elements**:

   - HTML uses tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to define elements on a webpage.

   - Elements can represent headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.



2. **Document Structure**:

   - An HTML document typically starts with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration followed by an `<html>` tag.

   - Inside the `<html>` tag, you'll find the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.

     - The `<head>` contains metadata (such as the page title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets).

     - The `<body>` contains the visible content of the webpage.



3. **Basic Tags**:

   - `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings (with `<h1>` being the highest level).

   - `<p>`: Paragraphs.

   - `<a>`: Links (anchors).

   - `<img>`: Images.

   - `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists.

   - `<table>`: Tables.



4. **Attributes**:

   - Tags can have attributes that provide additional information.

   - For example, the `<a>` tag has an `href` attribute for specifying the link URL.



5. **Nesting and Hierarchy**:

   - Elements can be nested inside each other to create a hierarchy.

   - Proper indentation helps maintain readability.



6. **Closing Tags**:

   - Some tags are self-closing (e.g., `<img>`), while others require opening and closing tags (e.g., `<p>`).



7. **Semantic HTML**:

   - Use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to give meaning to your content.



Remember that HTML provides the foundation for building web pages, and it works in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Happy coding!
